# website feature

It is a social matrimony site. This is a fully dynamic site.
Where this site of mine will work on the layout of two completely different users. Like here a user can create his profile and find the boy/girl of his choice. He can become a premium member if he wants and if he is not a premium member then he will not be able to see the contract information of a boy/girl for which he will have to request 500 rupees.
On the other hand, let's come to the admin dashboard where an admin can add, delete, premium members.
Besides, contact information request, premium request except left can be deleted.
I have given privacy to all funds of this site. Here you will find two different dashboards.
